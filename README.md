# Quadratic-Equation-Solver
This Python program calculates the real roots of a quadratic equation given its coefficients and displays the results along with the original coefficients.

Write a python program to read three coefficients of a quadratic equation 
AX^2 + BX + C = 0 and find the roots of the equation 
(ignore the complex solution for now).
Roots formula
Root 1 = {-B + sqrt (B2 - 4*A*C)}/2A = 
          	Root 2 = {-B - sqrt (B^2 - 4*A*C)}/2A =    
NB. Use power of Â½ for square root operation.

Things to do in the program:
1.	Input
	  Receive the coefficients (A, B, C) individually and interactively from the keyboard with a specific prompt message specifying the coefficient being received.

2.	Calculate the roots (two roots)

3.	Output 
    Display coefficient A
    Display coefficient B
    Display coefficient C
    Display the roots
